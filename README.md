1  -  Upload the 'app/back/db/database-drop.sql' database to phpMyAdmin.


2  -  Make sure to check 'app/back/dbconnect.php' and 'app/front/security/path.php' to customize your application directory and connection variables.


3  -  Check the database for the available logins (e.g email:cassiano@email, password:Cassiano)

To start, go to the 'index.php' file or 'login.php', both present in 'app/front/', 'index.php' being in '/paginas/'.

>You will have 15 minutes of access after logging in, as both the JWT and SESSION will expire.
